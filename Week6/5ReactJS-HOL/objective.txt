1)  Need for Styling React Components.
Styling is a crucial part of building user interfaces, and in React, it's just as important as in traditional web development. Styling React components helps make applications visually appealing, user-friendly, and aligned with brand identity. Without proper styling, even the most functional app can feel incomplete or hard to use. In React, component-based architecture allows you to scope styles to specific components, which helps maintain modularity and avoid global CSS conflicts. This means that you can design reusable UI components that look consistent throughout your app while being easy to manage and debug.

2) Working with CSS Modules and Inline Styles
React supports multiple ways to apply styles, with CSS Modules and inline styles being two common approaches. CSS Modules let you write regular CSS but scope it to individual components automatically. This avoids class name collisions and keeps styles modular and clean. For example, you can create a Button.module.css file and import it into your Button.jsx component, applying styles using object syntax like className={styles.btn}.
On the other hand, inline styles are defined directly within the component as JavaScript objects. They are useful for applying dynamic styles or quick adjustments. For example, { color: 'red', fontSize: '20px' } can be passed directly to an element using the style prop. While inline styles are fast and convenient for conditional styling, they are limited in terms of advanced features like pseudo-selectors (:hover, :focus) and media queries, which CSS Modules handle well.
