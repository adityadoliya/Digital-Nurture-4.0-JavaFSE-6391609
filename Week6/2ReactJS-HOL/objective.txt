1) Explain React Components
React components are the building blocks of any React application. Think of them like JavaScript functions that return HTML-like UI elements. They let us split our UI into reusable, independent pieces that can be managed and rendered efficiently. Each component in React can maintain its own state and logic, which makes it easier to build complex UIs by combining smaller parts.

2) Difference Between React Components and JavaScript Functions
React components look similar to regular JavaScript functions especially functional components. However, the key difference is that React components return JSX (JavaScript XML), which gets converted into actual DOM elements.

3)Types of React Components
There are mainly two types of React components:Class components and Functioncomponents. Class components are the traditional way of writing components, where we define a class that extends React.Component and includes lifecycle methods and a render() function. Function components on the other hand are simpler and rely on hooks like useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects.

4) Explain Class Component
A class component in React is a JavaScript class that extends React.Componen`. It has a lifecycle meaning it goes through stages like mounting, updating, and unmounting. These components must include a render() method that returns JSX, which defines what should be displayed on the screen. Class components can also have constructor to initialize state and bind methods.

5) Explain Function Component
Function components are simpler ways to define components using plain JavaScript functions. With the introduction of React Hooks, they can now manage state and side effects as well. A function component accepts `props` as its argument and returns JSX to render UI. 

6) Define Component Constructor
The constructor is a special method used in class components. It is  called once when the component is created and is primarily used for initializing state and binding event handlers. we call super(props) inside the constructor to access this.props.

7) Define render() Function
The render() function is a required method in every class component. It returns the JSX that defines what the UI should look like. This function is automatically called by React whenever the component needs to be drawn or re-drawn such as when state or props change.
